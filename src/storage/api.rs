/// It operates on batches of records (`RecordBatch`) as opaque byte blocks,
/// making it a "logically blind" component focused on efficient and reliable persistence.
/// The storage layer does not understand the internal structure of the batches; it trusts
/// the upper layers (e.g., the Broker) to provide validated data and necessary metadata
/// like the number of records in a batch.
///
/// Any struct that implements this trait can be used as the underlying storage engine for Bifrost.
/// This design allows us to easily switch or add new storage implementations in the future
/// without modifying the upper business logic code.
///
/// The `Send + Sync` constraint is required because it allows storage engine instances
/// to be safely shared in a multithreaded environment.
